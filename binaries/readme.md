This directory contains binary distributions of the dryadd Dryad migrator and monitor script. Details on its use are available here <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/dryad2dataverse/scripts/>. Note that these files *do not* require installation of the *dryad2dataverse* Python library; they are stand-alone executable files.

These are console binaries; they should be run from the command prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Mac). For ease of use consider one of the following options:

* Adding the file to your machine's PATH
* Creating an alias
* In the case of Mac OS, placing it in /usr/local/bin
