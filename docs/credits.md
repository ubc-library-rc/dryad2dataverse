## Acknowledgements

No software development is done in a vacuum, and this project is no exception.

Thanks to Eugene Barsky,Doug Brigham and Jeremy Buhler of the University of British Columbia library [Research Commons](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca) for their assistance and support, to Ryan Scherle of [Dryad](https://datadryad.org) for his help with the Dryad API, and the helpful people at [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org).

Without the fabulous [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library and [the requests toolbelt](https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user.html) everything would have taken a great deal longer.

Without [pydoc-markdown](https://pydoc-markdown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [schemaspy](http://schemaspy.org/) the documentation would have taken much, much longer to write.
