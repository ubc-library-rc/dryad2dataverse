However, the patterns of which species and trees are most vulnerable to drought, and the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive, in part due to the lack of relevant data and difficulty of predicting the location of catastrophic drought years in advance. We used long\u2010term demographic records and extensive databases of functional traits and distribution patterns to understand the responses of 20 to 53 species to an extreme drought in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Costa Rica, which occurred during the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation event. Overall, species-specific mortality rates during the drought ranged from 0% to 34%, and varied little as a function of tree size. By contrast, hydraulic safety margins correlated well with probability of mortality among species, while morphological or leaf economics spectrum traits did not. This firmly suggests hydraulic traits as targets for future research.</p>\r\n", "funders": [{"organization": "National Science Foundation", "awardNumber": "CAREER grant DEB 1053237"}, {"organization": "National Science Foundation", "awardNumber": "PRFB 1711366"}, {"organization": "National Science Foundation", "awardNumber": "CRN3025"}, {"organization": "Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Costa Rica", "awardNumber": ""}, {"organization": "Australian Research Council", "awardNumber": "DP170100761"}, {"organization": "Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda", "awardNumber": ""}, {"organization": "U.S. Department of Energy", "awardNumber": "DESC0014363"}], "keywords": ["drought", "Tree mortality", "Costa Rica"], "methods": "<p>The dataset contains annual observations of tree mortality in different 18 plots, expanded sampling for mortality during 2015, and datasets of plant functional and hydraulic traits.\u00a0 Please refer to the publication for exact methods.\u00a0 All data come from Guanacaste, Costa Rica.</p>\r\n", "usageNotes": "<p>All data and associated R scripts are contained in the files.
