##Using sqlite

The easiest way to play around with sqlite if you don't want to use the command line is to use **DB Browser for SQLite"**:

[DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

### Database generation

The script which generates the database and Python doi pickle is in `./scripts`

The database itself is in this directory as `dryadInfo.db`

### Queries

Interesting queries are stored in the `./queries` directory

### CSV and other output

Query exports and other CSVs are stored in `./output`

## Zipfile of raw JSON from dryad

The script also saves the raw JSON as individual files in case someone needs to look at them. They are saved as `dryadjson.zip`
